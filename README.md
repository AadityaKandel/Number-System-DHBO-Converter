# Number-System-DHBO-Converter
This is the code available of DHBO CONVERTER APPLICATION


There was an small error in this program. The error was small but finding the error was hard especially considering the fact that
I tried to correct the error after 8 months of making the program. Even though it was a small error, it had substantial effect on
the program since it completely obliterated the LOGIC for Calculating Some Problems. 

Update2: From now on, you can do fractional calculations (i.e 66.66, 5AC.ABC etc) on my program and it will still give you the step-wise-step
answer in language format. You can do all combinations because I've added every combination (total 12 combinations) in this program. By
combination, I mean Binary to Hexa, Binary to Decimal and so on....

[Previously, I had added 10 combinations and wasn't able to find errors because of no compiling errors. The errors were within the program so
it was hard to find. But not after few hours, I found the error and solved it]

My code is repititive which I completely agree but its under my knowledge so I couldn't make it any better. But I'll definitely make it better in 
the future.

ENJOY!!
