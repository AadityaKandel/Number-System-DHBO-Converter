# Number-System-DHBO-Converter
This is the code available of DHBO CONVERTER APPLICATION


There was an small error in this program. The error was small but finding the error was hard especially considering the fact that
I tried to correct the error after 8 months of making the program. Even though it was a small error, it had substantial effect on
the program since it completely obliterated the LOGIC for Calculating Some Problems. 

Update2: I've added 'fraction calculation' so you can easily calculate fraction problems on my program. Besides Hexadecimal to Octal & Vice Versa,
every other number system (10 combinations) support fraction calculation. I'll also add fractional calculation to H to O & Vice Versa but for now,
I am unable to do so. It is because of the sheer length of the code and no compilation errors, I am unable to track where the error actually is.
So, I am unable to solve it.

My code is repititive which I completely agree but its under my knowledge so I couldn't make it any better. But I'll definitely make it better in 
the future.

ENJOY!!
